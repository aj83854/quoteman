quoteman
========
QuoteMan (short for QuoteManager, or QuoteManipulator if you like) is a small module with a few useful functions for scraping and manipulating quote text from a website built for web-scraping practice: http://quotes.toscrape.com/

Contents
--------
1. Module
  - quoteman.py *(ex: import quoteman as qm)*
   
2. Tests
  - qm_test.py
    
    *Currently has only two VERY weak tests- I'm still learning TDD, which can be quite the challenge by yourself*
  
3. Examples
  - make-quote-csv.py
  
    *Takes scraped quotes and puts them into a csv file*
  
  - guess-that-quote.py
  
    *Uses qm methods implemented in a game to guess author of randomly provided quote*

Change-log 
----------
1. Added source files and populated README.md

Background
----------
I wrote this for an online Python course assignment. Obviously, I could have just spaghetti-coded it- but, I really wanted to practice making things as tidy and useful/professional looking as possible, and I ended up writing a neat little module.

I'll add some additional features and details for the readme as I think of them/time allows.
